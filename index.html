            <p style="text-align: center;">
                My passions are people, problem solving, and enjoying the fruits of my labor. I have been with Ford
                Motor
                Credit for 5 years and I have been on the quality assurance team for 2 years. I have enjoyed my time as
                a Quality Assurance Coach
                because it gives me the opportunity to directly help the team members I evaluate develope their skills
                and be more impactful
                with the organization. Before I joined Ford Motor Credit I worked as a Property Manager who over saw an
                apartment community that
                housed over 100 apartment homes.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                I want to become a software engineer because I want to empower myself to change the world and to
                challange myself
                with a skill set that I have very little understanding of. While most of my creative hobbies result in
                physical results
                I am very excited about the creative possibilities coding will provide me because there are no physical
                limitations which means
                virtually anything is possible! I also look forward to collaborating with different people on various
                projects because
                there is always something new to learn and I believe learning to code will give me the opportunity to
                learn from and collaborate with people that have
                different backgrounds and experiences.
